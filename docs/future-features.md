# Future Features & Use Cases

This document captures planned features and use case ideas for the Obsidian Journal Analyzer plugin.

## Implemented Features

### v0.1.0 - Journal Analyzer (Current)
- ✅ Analyze recent journal entries (configurable date range)
- ✅ Custom date range analysis
- ✅ Pattern recognition across entries
- ✅ Auto-generated meta notes with proper frontmatter
- ✅ Theme identification and insight generation

## Planned Features

### Interview Prep Auto-Generator

**Problem it solves:** Manually researching companies, preparing questions, and creating comprehensive interview prep documents is time-consuming.

**How it works:**
- Point the plugin at a company's website, engineering blog, LinkedIn profiles
- Generates comprehensive prep documents (like the Artsy interview guide)
- Researches layoff history, tech stack, leadership transitions
- Suggests questions based on your background + company context
- Updates prep docs as you add journal entries about conversations

**Commands:**
- `Create Interview Prep: [Company Name]`
- `Update Interview Prep from Journal`

**Configuration:**
- Template for interview prep notes
- Sources to search (blogs, LinkedIn, news)
- Your resume/background file for personalization

**Example Output:**
```markdown
# [Company] Interview Prep

## Company Overview
[Auto-researched from web]

## Technical Stack
[From engineering blog]

## Recent News & Changes
[Layoffs, pivots, leadership changes]

## Questions to Ask
[Based on your background + their context]

## Your Relevant Experience
[Connects your resume to their needs]
```

### Knowledge Graph Connector

**Problem it solves:** Obsidian's graph view is only useful if notes are well-linked. Finding meaningful connections manually is hard.

**How it works:**
- Analyzes all vault notes for thematic connections
- Suggests wiki-links you haven't created
- Example: "This mention of 'making art less intimidating' in VTS journal connects to Artsy interview notes"
- Proactively builds the web of connections
- Generates "bridge notes" that connect disparate topics

**Commands:**
- `Find Missing Connections`
- `Suggest Links for Current Note`
- `Generate Bridge Note: [Topic A] ↔ [Topic B]`

**Configuration:**
- Minimum connection confidence threshold
- Types of connections to surface (thematic, temporal, causal)
- Folders to include/exclude

**Example Output:**
```markdown
# Suggested Connections

## Current Note: journal/2025-10-17.md

Potential links:
1. "making art less intimidating" → [[projects/artsy-interview-prep]]
   Confidence: 95% | Reason: Exact phrase match, related context

2. "sabbatical from VTS" → [[projects/vts-opportunity-analysis]]
   Confidence: 87% | Reason: Same entity, career decision theme

3. "commitment vs casual" → [[journal/2025-10-19]] (Zen practice)
   Confidence: 92% | Reason: Same decision framework, different domain
```

### Context-Aware Note Templates

**Problem it solves:** Templates are powerful but static. Dynamic templates that adapt to context would be more useful.

**How it works:**
- Smart templates that adapt based on context
- Job application notes that pre-fill company research
- Book notes that pull in reviews, themes, author background
- Interview debriefs that reference your prep docs and ask follow-up questions
- Project notes that understand your existing project structure

**Commands:**
- `New Job Application: [Company]`
- `New Book Note: [Title]`
- `New Interview Debrief`
- `New Project: [Name]`

**Configuration:**
- Template definitions with dynamic fields
- Data sources for auto-population
- Custom template types

**Example - Job Application Template:**
```markdown
# {{company_name}} - {{role_title}}

## Company Research
{{auto_fetch_from_web}}

## Why This Role
[Your input - but prompt based on company mission]

## Application Timeline
- Applied: {{today}}
- Status: Pending

## Salary Research
{{auto_fetch_salary_data}}

## Questions for Interview
{{generate_from_job_description}}
```

### Decision Journal Assistant

**Problem it solves:** Making good decisions requires tracking assumptions, testing them over time, and learning from outcomes. Hard to do manually.

**How it works:**
- Creates structured decision frameworks
- Example: "Artsy vs VTS vs keep searching"
- Tracks assumptions and tests them over time
- References past similar decisions and outcomes
- Generates "decision review" notes 3/6/12 months later

**Commands:**
- `Create Decision Framework: [Decision Name]`
- `Log Decision Outcome`
- `Review Past Decisions`
- `Compare Similar Decisions`

**Configuration:**
- Review intervals (default: 3, 6, 12 months)
- Decision template structure
- Outcome tracking fields

**Example Output:**
```markdown
# Decision: Artsy vs VTS (Oct 2025)

- I can thrive in uncertain environment

### Option B: VTS
**Pros:**
- Known quantity
- Resume narrative cleanup
- Financial stability

**Cons:**
- No mission alignment

- Identifies long-term patterns
- Visualizes decision-making trends

**Commands:**
- `Generate Meta Dashboard`
- `Show Theme Evolution: [Theme]`

- Share and import community prompts

**Examples:**
- Career decision analysis
- Emotional pattern tracking
- Relationship dynamics
- Creative idea synthesis
- Learning progress tracking

## Implementation Priority

1. **v0.1.0** - Journal Analyzer (✅ Implemented)
2. **v0.2.0** - Knowledge Graph Connector (high value, builds on v0.1)
3. **v0.3.0** - Decision Journal Assistant (solves current problem)
4. **v0.4.0** - Context-Aware Templates (enables other features)

## Technical Considerations

### Claude Code Integration Approaches

1. **CLI Integration** (Current approach)
   - Spawn child process
   - Pipe content to Claude Code
   - Parse response

2. **API Integration** (Future)
   - Direct API calls to Claude
   - More reliable, faster
   - Requires API key management

3. **Hybrid** (Best)
   - Use Claude Code CLI when available
   - Fallback to API with user's key
   - Configuration option for preference

### Performance Optimization

- Cache analysis results
- Incremental analysis (only new entries)
- Background processing for large date ranges
- Rate limiting for API calls

### Privacy & Security

- All analysis stays local
- Option to exclude sensitive entries
- No data sent to external services (except Claude API)
- Configurable content filtering

## Community Features

- Share analysis templates
- Import/export configurations
- Plugin marketplace integration
- Documentation site with examples
